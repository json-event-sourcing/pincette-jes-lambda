# JSON Event Sourcing AWS Lambda Trigger

This microservice calls AWS Lambdas with messages from Kafka topics. The topics should use the [serialisation of JSON Event Sourcing](https://www.javadoc.io/static/net.pincette/pincette-jes-util/1.1.3/net/pincette/jes/util/JsonSerde.html).

## Configuration

The configuration is managed by the 
[Lightbend Config package](https://github.com/lightbend/config). By default it will try to load ```conf/application.conf```. An alternative configuration may be loaded by adding ```-Dconfig.resource=myconfig.conf```, where the file is also supposed to be in the ```conf``` directory. The following entries are available.

|Entry|Description|
|---|---|
|logLevel|The level of the logger. The default value is "INFO".|
|logTopic|The name of the log Kafka topic. This entry is mandatory.|
|kafka|All Kafka settings come below this entry. So for example, the setting ```bootstrap.servers``` would go to the entry ```kafka.bootstrap.servers```.|
|kafka.num.stream.threads|The number of worker threads per instance.|
|kafka.replication.factor|When using Confluent Cloud this should be 3.|
|triggers|This is an object where the keys are Kafka topics and the values are arrays of AWS ARNs denoting lambda functions.|

## Building and Running

You can build the tool with ```mvn clean package```. This will produce a self-contained JAR-file in the ```target``` directory with the form ```pincette-jes-lambda-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar```. You can launch this JAR with ```java -jar```, without further options.

The total number of threads across all the instances should not exceed the number of partitions for the Kafka topics. Additional threads will be idle.

You can run the JVM with the option ```-mx128m```.

## Docker

Docker images can be found at [https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jsoneventsourcing/pincette-jes-lambda](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jsoneventsourcing/pincette-jes-lambda). You should add a configuration layer with a Docker file that looks like this:

```
FROM registry.hub.docker.com/jsoneventsourcing/pincette-jes-lambda:<version>
COPY conf/tst.conf /conf/application.conf
```

So wherever your configuration file comes from, it should always end up at ```/conf/application.conf```.
